<p>I just finished reading <i>As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning</i> by Laurie Lee. It's an autobiography recounting the author leaving home at 18, walking through England then deciding on a whim to go to Spain. It was 1934 and his walk illustrates how desperately poor Spain was, how bound up it was with the church and how cut off it was. By the time he reaches the southern coast the tension is building for the Spanish Civil War which was basically the precursor to World War II. He writes how Spain has remained largely unchanged in its social structure since Roman times and that is certainly the impression you get from the horrific descriptions of poverty in the rest of the book.
<p>According to Lee despite the wider political context the Republicans are not communists, neither do they have any real connection to European socialism or anarchism; they see it as their own struggle. There are signs of the outside world though, in his travels Lee encounters many Jewish refugees who have fled from Germany.
</p>
<p>The book is probably the most beautifully written I've read yet and relatively short. It ends ominously with Lee trapped in the Republican stronghold of Almuñécar. The Republicans tear out the casinos and the rich villas and label them "<i>Here will be the Nursery School</i>" and "<i>Here will be a Training College for Girls</i>". None of these hopes will be realised of course as the fascists will win the war and Spain will live under the same crushing tyranny, censorship, rigid class system and of course the Catholic church until 1975 when Fransisco Franco (already his name feared by the peasants of the village) dies and the country is free.
</p>
<p>Lee is evacuated by a passing British ship. Although as he describes he later returned to Spain to fight in the war like so many acting of their own volition. It is reminiscent of the stories of individuals going to fight in Ukraine. This comparison spells a dreadful future for our current situation as in the 1934 the build up to another major conflict in Europe is certain - fate is sealed.
<br>"<i>A German airship passed above us, nosing inquisitively along the coast, the swastika black on its gleaming hull. To Spain, so backward and so long ignored, the nation's of Europe were quietly gathering.</i>"
